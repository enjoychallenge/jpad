git clone https://github.com/jirik/ol3ds.git
cd ol3ds
npm install
bower install
sudo grunt install (Linux) / grunt install (Windows)
```
### Problems with installation
Windows users: If you have some errors during `npm install` related to [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp), you will probably need to install [Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2012 Express for Windows Desktop](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34673) and run the installation again.

## Development
* `grunt` to run dev server and open Hello World in the browser
  * Edit content of `client/src/js/webpages/index.js` and see changes in the browser
* `grunt lint` to run gjslint
* `grunt fix` to run fixjsstyle

## Build
* `grunt build` to compile the code and copy files to `client/public`
* `grunt build --map` to include also [source maps](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-debugging#source-maps)
